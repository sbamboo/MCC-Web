                <h2>About The Project</h2>
                <p>MinecraftCustomClient or mcc for short (no not Minecraft Championship), was created for my friends to be more easiely be able to download my modpacks.</p>
                <p>The first version or V1(legacy) worked great but it was a hastle for me to publish modpacks on their because of al the prep work, thus i created v2.</p>
                <p>V2 is very much in development but alot of the features are there, and this website exists as a simple place to download them from.</p>
                <p>I hope it can be a usefull tool and thank you for using it!</p>
                <i>If you have any feedback or problems contact me and ill see what i can do, sadly i can't offer support on such pre-release softwere so use it at your own risk.</i>
